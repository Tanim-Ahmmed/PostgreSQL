///1.1
relational database management


1. what is database?

a database is a structured collection of related data , that relate some real world entities and are organized for efficient retrival storage and management.

2. what is data?

data is facts , that can be recorded in form of manything..

3. what is information?

information is a proccesed and organized data 




/// 1.2

dbms 
a software that helps us to manage databse ...
with dbms we can handle... unstuctured , redundencry , concurrency , inconsistency, sequrity, access comlication 


////1.3

dbms models 

hierarchical 
network
relational
document
key value 


relational: table formate data , reallife entity is name phone number etc, key is a uniqly identifier of a row , primary key is a key of an table a , for table b , a's key is Foreign key




///1.4

TABLE / relation

first of all need to define entities

for user table,
column / attribute 
constraint / domain
a full row is tuple/ reccord 

all collection of column is Degree

all of rows is cardinality


//// 1.5

Keys 

key in a relational databse is a field or a combination of fields that uniqly identifies a record in a table


primary key, super key, candidate key, alternate key, composite key , foreign key

supper key can be single or set of  attribute , that can uniqly identifies a row .

////1.6


candidate key is that type of super key, that can not be breakable as a super key, also candidate key is a potential primary key .


primary key must be uniqe , not null, stable or dose not change .
primary key is a  one of main candidate key or single candidate key.  


alternate key, is that candidate keys , that not choscen as primary key.

///1.7
Foreign key:  one table primary key is Foreign key of another table .

planning > analysis > system design> building> testing > deployment 


databse design is a part of system design .....


techniques of design databse
1. top-down 
2. bottom-up

///1.9

dtabase design steps 
top-down 

1. determining entities

2. determining attribute

3. determining relationship

4. if there in the relationship any many to many relation then resoleve 
it .

////1.10
relationship and relationship cardinality

connection between entity and table 


cardinality

how many instances one entity is associeted with how many instances of another entities

one to one
one to many
many to many
